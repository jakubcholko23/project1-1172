                        <p>Before coming to the university, I went to Christ the King High school, where I learned my first coding language, python. I have joined many clubs at Chist the King including Robotics, Writing Club, and National Honor Society. I graduated in June 2023 with Honors and now I currently go to St. John's University. I am junior and majoring in Computer Science, while also minoring in Cyber Security and joining National Society of Leadership and Success in St.John's University.</p>

                            <dd>I have created a GPA calculator that asks the user for their grade and hours receieved for each class that the student wants to record and provides the students GPA. The project is programmed in Java and uses HashMap, JavaSwing as the interface, and ArrayLists.</dd>

                            <dd>For this project, I have worked with 2 other students to create a bookstore database. We started by defining out entities, atttributes and relationships that will be needed for the database and created a ER diagram. Then we created our final draft with an EER Diagram and used MySQl to start creating the database. We programmed the database in MySQL and added data to see if it worked and simulated search results by using SQL commands such as joins. We also normalized the schema so that there we no redundandcies within it.</dd>
